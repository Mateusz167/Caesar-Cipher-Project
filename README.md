# Caesar-Cipher-Project
## Overview
The Caesar Cipher project is a simple implementation of one of the oldest known encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar. This project provides a command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar Cipher method, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features
Encryption: Encrypts a given plaintext message by shifting letters by a specified number of positions.
Decryption: Decrypts a given ciphertext message by reversing the shift.
Configurable Shift: Allows the user to specify the number of positions to shift the letters (the key).
